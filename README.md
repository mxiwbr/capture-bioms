A PaperMC plugin that lets players capture a biome in a bottle and release it elsewhere.

## Features
- **Capture Biomes** allows you to capture a biome in a bottle as a **Biome Potion** by throwing XP Bottles on a **Beacon** and release it elsewhere
- Potion colors, names and description match the captured biome
- Get **bigger Biome Potions** depending on the **size of the Beacon pyramid**
- **Full control**: Edit the plugin's config to adapt it to your preferences

## Usage
1. Place a Beacon and power it with the usual pyramid
2. Drop the required amount of XP bottles on top of the beacon:
   - Tier 1 Beacon + 16 XP bottles → 4x4 Biome Potion
   - Tier 2 Beacon + 32 XP bottles → 8x8 Biome Potion
   - Tier 3 Beacon + 48 XP bottles → 16x16 Biome Potion
   - Tier 4 Beacon + 64 XP bottles → 32x32 Biome Potion
3. The beacon automatically creates a **Biome Potion** of the biome in which the beacon is located
4. Throw the potion on the ground in another biome to change the biome in the area  

The tier of the Beacon depends on the size of the pyramid:
- 1 layer → Tier 1
- 2 layers → Tier 2
- 3 layers → Tier 3
- 4 layers → Tier 4

## Potion Size
The size of a Biome Potion depends on the tier of the beacon used to create it.  
When thrown, the potion affects a square of `size` × `size` blocks, `size` being the matching value for the Beacon tier (configurable in the `config.yml`).   

**Example:** A potion created on a tier 2 Beacon affects an area of 8 × 8 blocks, with the location where the potion lands as the center.

**Height behavior:**
- If there is a solid block above the center coordinate (e.g. in a cave), the biome extends up to **five blocks above that block**.
- If there is no solid block above the center, the biome extends up to the **world's maximum height**.
- The biome always extends **five blocks below the point where the potion lands**.

## Supported Versions
- PaperMC on Minecraft Version 1.21.11

                                      # See https://github.com/mxiwbr/capture-biomes/blob/main/README.md to understand how the size works

  trigger_item: EXPERIENCE_BOTTLE     # The item that must be thrown on the beacon to trigger the biome capture
                                      # See https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html for the item names

                                      # this affects all potions created after changing this value - old items will still have the same cooldown settings!
                                      # recommended to leave enabled to prevent players from crashing / lagging the server by throwing too many potions at once

  enabled: true                       # default: true
                                      # boolean (true / false)
