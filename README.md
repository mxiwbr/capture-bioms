Ever dreamed of bringing a snowy tundra to your sunny desert world? Or maybe turn your forest into a swampy wonderland?  
With **Capture Biomes**, you can bottle up any biome and unleash it anywhere –
reshape your own Minecraft world exactly the way you want!

## Features
🧪 Capture any biome in a **Biome Potion** using a Beacon  
🎨 Potion colors, names, and descriptions match the captured biome  
📏 Bigger Biome Potions depending on the Beacon pyramid size  
⚙️ Full configuration support in the `config.yml`

## Usage
1. Place a Beacon and power it with the usual pyramid
2. Drop the required amount of XP bottles on top of the beacon:
   - Tier 1 Beacon + 16 XP bottles → 4x4 Biome Potion
   - Tier 2 Beacon + 32 XP bottles → 8x8 Biome Potion
   - Tier 3 Beacon + 48 XP bottles → 16x16 Biome Potion
   - Tier 4 Beacon + 64 XP bottles → 32x32 Biome Potion
3. The beacon automatically creates a **Biome Potion** of the biome in which the beacon is located
4. Throw the potion on the ground in another biome to change the biome in the area  

The tier of the Beacon depends on the size of the pyramid:
- 1 layer → Tier 1
- 2 layers → Tier 2
- 3 layers → Tier 3
- 4 layers → Tier 4

## Installation
1. Download the latest .jar from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/project/capture-biomes/versions) or [GitHub](https://github.com/mxiwbr/capture-biomes/releases)
2. Place it in your server's `plugins` folder
3. (Optional) Configure the plugin via `config.yml` and restart the server or use the plugin's reload command

## Potion Size
The size of a Biome Potion depends on the tier of the beacon used to create it.  
When thrown, the potion affects a cuboid of `size` × `size` × `size` blocks, `size` being the matching value for the Beacon tier (configurable in the `config.yml`).   

**Example:** A potion created on a tier 2 Beacon affects an area of 8 × 8 × 8 blocks, with the location where the potion lands as the center.

**Height behavior:**
- If there is a solid block above the center coordinate (e.g. in a cave), the biome extends up to **`size` blocks above that block**.
- If there is no solid block above the center, the biome extends up to the **world's maximum height**.
- The biome always extends **`size` blocks below the point where the potion lands**.
- The amount of blocks to extend up- and downwards is **configurable in the config.yml** by modifying the `y-offset-multiplier`.
